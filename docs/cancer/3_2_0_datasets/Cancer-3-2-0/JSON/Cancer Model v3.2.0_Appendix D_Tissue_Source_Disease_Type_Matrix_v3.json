If the diagnosis is not listed as a subtype it can be entered under \u201cother\u201d.  A tumour comprised of more than one subtype should be entered as follows:  The predominant tumour subtype in the sample sent for whole genome sequencing should be entered first.  The remaining subtypes should be entered in descending order with the most prevalant subtype in the whole tumour listed second.  It is helpful to include \u201cmixed tumour type\u201d as a subtype but this should not be entered alone.Allows for multiple subtypes delimited by a comma surrounded by double quotes i.e. \"xxxxxx,xxxxxxx\"",
